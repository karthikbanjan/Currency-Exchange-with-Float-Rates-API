# Currency Exchange using Float Rates API

A command-line program to get real-time exchange rates from Float Rates API and convert from a currency to another desired currency.

This simple python mini-project uses "requsts" package and gets exchange rate from the internet in JSON format.
Then converts the money given by user to the desired currency.

I used www.floatrates.com for all the exchange rates.
